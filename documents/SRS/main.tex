            \item The system shall first process a track layout file and convert that into a working logical data structure to represent the virtual track.
            \item The system shall next query the user to enter their relevant module in the TCSS\index{TCSS}.
            \item The system shall then display the information and allow the user to manipulate the relevant portions of the TCSS\index{TCSS}.
            \item All information that the user may not necessarily need to operate successfully will still be presented to the user. 
        \end{itemize}
        %CTC
        \item The system shall process a train schedule file and accurately display it to the Dispatcher\index{Dispatcher}.
        \item The system shall allow the Dispatcher \index{Dispatcher} to view a map of the current state of the rail system.
        \item The system shall allow the Dispatcher \index{Dispatcher} to assign a destination, suggested speed, and authority for a train to be dispatched.
        \item The system shall allow the Dispatcher \index{Dispatcher} to assign a schedule to a specific train, either through an automatically set schedule or by adding individual stops manually. Additionally, the TCSS shall allow a Dispatcher \index{Dispatcher} to save a manually created schedule as a preset for other trains to be dispatched.
        \item The system shall allow a train to repeat its schedule until instructed to stop.
        \item The system shall allow the Dispatcher \index{Dispatcher} to open and close blocks of the track for maintenance.

        \item The system shall accurately display the outputs of the PLC \index{PLC} file to the Track Controller \index{Track Controller} interface\index{interface}.
        

        %Track Model \index{Track Model}
        \item The system shall allow for input of a file to configure track layout. Track layout may be reconfigured by inputting a different file. This layout will include all static information with regards to the transit system layout. 
        
        %Train Model \index{Train Model}
        \item The system shall simulate the physics of trains, approximating it as a point mass.
        \item The system shall use the power command from the Train Controller \index{Train Controller} to adjust the velocity of the train, accounting for mass, load, and grade of the track.
        \item The system shall allow the train passenger and train driver to utilize the emergency brake, bringing the train to a complete stop at a predetermined rate of deceleration. 
        
        %Train Controller \index{Train Controller}
        \item The system shall allow the train driver to input a desired speed and automatically calculate the appropriate force command.
        \item The system shall allow the train driver to control the state of their train only within safe parameters set by the system (i.e., speed limits). 
        \item The system shall display current properties such as speed to the train driver.
        
        %General
        \item The system shall accurately notify the user of any errors in input.
        \item The system shall not allow the user to enter any illegal information, i.e. "forty-five" when the system requires an integer.
        \item The system shall update all output values in real-time. 
        \item The system shall safely respond to commands from the user that may cause the system to fail (i.e., causing two trains to collide).

    \subsection{Logical Database Requirements}
    \paragraph{}
    The TCSS\index{TCSS} system does not have any database requirements. All external data storage needs of the system are satisfied through reading from local files.
    
    \subsection{Design Constraints}
    \label{designconstraints}
    \paragraph{}
    Design constrains for the TCSS\index{TCSS} include the following:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The system must run in an operable manner (i.e., should not display large amounts of lag) on a standard, mid-range laptop with an Intel\textregistered \:i5 processor or equivalent. 
        \item Individual modules of the system must also be independently executable, and each must have its own Graphic User Interface.
        \item The system must be self-contained, i.e., it should be delivered via an executable file or similar archive that includes all files necessary for the system to run.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{Software System Attributes}
   
    \subsubsection{Reliability}
    \paragraph{}
    The TCSS\index{TCSS} shall be capable of operating for at least one simulated day without failure.

    \subsubsection{Availability}
    \paragraph{}
    The TCSS\index{TCSS} shall be used on-demand. There are no recovery requirements in the case of a program failure or program crash.

    \subsubsection{Security}
    \paragraph{}
    There are no security constraints for this application.
    

    \subsubsection{Maintainability}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each module of the TCSS\index{TCSS} shall be capable of executing on its own.
        \item Each module of the TCSS\index{TCSS} shall contain its own GUI.
        \item Each module of the TCSS\index{TCSS} shall be compatible with the testing scenarios.
    \end{itemize}
   
    
    Specify attributes of software that relate to the ease of maintenance of the software itself.  There may be some requirement for certain modularity, interfaces \index{interface}, complexity, etc.  Requirements should not be placed here just because they are thought to be good design practices. If someone else will maintain the system
    

    \subsubsection{Portability}
    
    \paragraph{}
    This system is to be as portable as possible. To accomplish this, the system will be written using Java; the system will be able to be compiled and run on any system with the JRE installed. 
    
    \paragraph{} It would be ideal, however, for the system's deliverable to be structured in such a way that the JRE is not a requirement. If this goal can be met, focus will be placed on formatting the system to run on any Windows 10 machine, as specified in section \ref{designconstraints} Design Constraints on page \pageref{designconstraints}.
    


\section{Change Management Process}

\paragraph{}
Changes to the SRS \index{SRS} must be done following a strict process in order to maintain the accuracy of the document, the functionality and consistency of the product, and to keep all team members informed and up to date.
\begin{itemize}
    \item All changes to the SRS \index{SRS} or TCSS\index{TCSS} must be proposed to the entire team before implementing. Such proposals should be done in writing via the team's designated channels or verbally in meetings with a majority of the team present.
    \item All changes must be agreed upon by a majority of the team. Minor changes can be discussed and approved in writing via communication channels; major changes must be discussed in one of the team's weekly meetings.
    \item Any proposed changes discussed in weekly meetings, whether approved or discarded, should be recorded in the meeting notes and distributed to all members of the team for reference and the record.
    \item If a proposed change will disproportionately affect one team member (i.e., a change specifically to a single module versus a change in overall architecture), then that team member must approve of the change.
\end{itemize}
